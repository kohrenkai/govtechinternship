# Marketplace Insights

## 1. Common User Pain Points
- **Unclear postings**: Students often list items with incomplete descriptions or missing photos, leading to frustration for buyers.  
- **Flaky participants**: Buyers/sellers may back out at the last minute or fail to show up, wasting time.  
- **Navigation confusion**: New users struggle with finding items quickly or posting their first listing.  
- **Price uncertainty**: Students may not know the fair market value of textbooks or furniture, resulting in disputes.  

**Chatbot requirement:**  
Therefore the chatbot should provide **step-by-step posting guidance**, offer **pricing tips**, help users navigate features efficiently and assist users who meet flaky buyers/sellers to escalate to moderators

## 2. Safety & Trust Challenges
- **Scams and fraud**: Fake listings, payment scams, and requests for deposits are common.  
- **Inappropriate items**: Prohibited items (e.g., alcohol, cigarettes, pets, weapons) must be filtered.  
- **Harassment**: Students may face spam messages or harassment after transactions.  
- **Trust gap**: Since participants are peers, enforcement of rules must feel both strict and fair.  

**Chatbot requirement:**  
The chatbot should have **safety guardrails**, automatically **warn about prohibited behavior**, and provide **clear escalation pathways** to moderators.  
It should also remind users of **safe meet-up practices** (e.g., meet in public areas on campus).

## 3. Seasonal Patterns
- **Semester Start/End**: High demand for textbooks, stationery, and study materials.  
- **Dorm Move-In/Out**: Furniture, appliances, and dorm supplies peak in demand.  
- **Graduation Period**: Gowns, memorabilia, and professional attire are traded, Seniors may also sell their used textbooks or old applicances in their dorms.  
- **Summer/Winter Breaks**: Fewer active users, but some may sell off unused items before leaving campus.  

**Chatbot requirement:**  
The chatbot should provide **timely reminders** (e.g., “It’s the start of semester — here’s how to buy/sell textbooks safely”) and adjust recommendations to match seasonal needs.

## 4. Integration with University Systems
- **Email Verification**: Restrict marketplace access to verified student emails to ensure trust and exclusivity.  
- **Campus Calendar Integration**: Use academic calendar for context of seasonal periods (exam weeks, holidays, graduation).  
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Simplify login by using university accounts.  
- **Moderator Integration**: Chatbot should escalate severe cases to human moderators via existing university support channels. This will also help build up the trust from the students knowing its backed by an offical organisation. 

**Chatbot requirement:**  
The chatbot should be tightly integrated with **university identity systems** for authentication, and linked with **campus support structures** for safety escalation.
