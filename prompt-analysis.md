# Prompt Analysis

The context section was designed to ground the chatbot in the reality of NTU student life in Singapore. By specifying that this is a marketplace chatbot for both local and international students, the prompt reflects authentic use cases: textbooks at semester start, dorm supplies during move-in and move-out, and graduation-related sales near the end of studies. Referencing NTU-specific spaces such as North Spine and South Spine makes the chatbot feel more relevant and trustworthy. This local grounding ensures the bot speaks to the actual needs of NTU students rather than a generic marketplace user.

The overall structure follows the **TCREI framework** (Task, Context, References, Evaluate, Iterate). The Task clearly defines the chatbotâ€™s role as a support assistant, while the Context embeds rules and marketplace culture. References provide few-shot examples of good responses, teaching the model how to handle navigation, posting, escalation, and refusal of out-of-scope queries. The Evaluate section adds chain-of-thought style reasoning to break down complex queries, while Iterate emphasizes self-refinement, asking the chatbot to check and improve its own responses.

Finally, the design emphasizes **safety guardrails and user scenarios**. Different user types are supported: buyers searching, sellers posting, and new users learning to navigate. Safety risks are addressed through explicit guardrails that reject prohibited items, warn against unsafe meetups, and escalate harassment or fraud to moderators. Additional scope control ensures that if students ask irrelevant questions, the chatbot politely reminds them of its purpose as a marketplace assistant. These measures reduce hallucinations and enforce policy compliance.
